        "* Mean Squared Error (MSE): MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values, which penalizes larger errors more heavily than smaller errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): RMSE is the square root of MSE and provides an easily interpretable measure of the model's average prediction error.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Coefficient of Determination (R-squared): R-squared measures the proportion of variance in the target variable that can be explained by the model, with higher values indicating a better fit.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Time Series Plots: Visualizations such as time series plots, which show the actual and predicted demand/sales values over time, can help identify any trends or patterns in the data that the model may have missed.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Residual Plots: Residual plots, which show the differences between the actual and predicted values, can help identify any systematic biases or errors in the model's predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Cross-Validation: Cross-validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation, can help estimate the model's performance on new data by testing it on multiple subsets of the available data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The choice of evaluation metrics and techniques would depend on the specific requirements of Meesho's use case and the nature of the data being analyzed. By carefully selecting appropriate evaluation methods, we can ensure that the model is accurately capturing the underlying patterns and dynamics in the data, and is able to make reliable predictions of demand/sales for different products and time periods."

In other words, the CLT states that as the sample size increases, the sample mean tends to become normally distributed, regardless of the underlying distribution of the population.\n",

        "There are several ways to determine which variable to use for splitting the data at each node, but one commonly used method is the Gini impurity index.

The lower the Gini impurity index, the more homogeneous the node is with respect to the outcome variable.\n",

        "Once the best split variable is selected, the algorithm splits the data into two groups based on the values of that variable.

The simplex is called a simplex because it is the simplest polytope that can represent a probability distribution. The vertices of the simplex represent the extreme probability distributions, where one outcome has a probability of 1 and the others have a probability of 0.

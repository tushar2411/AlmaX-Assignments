Logistic Regression is used to model the relationship between the independent variables and the probability of the dependent variable being in a particular category.\n",

The sigmoid function ensures that the output is always between 0 and 1.\n",

        "Using MSE as a cost function for logistic regression would result in a non-convex optimization problem, making it difficult to optimize the parameters of the model. Instead, logistic regression uses the log loss or cross-entropy loss function as the cost function. The log loss function penalizes the model for incorrect predictions by increasing the cost exponentially as the predicted probability moves away from the actual label, thus allowing the model to learn from its mistakes and improve its predictions."

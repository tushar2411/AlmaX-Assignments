It does this by training each decision tree on a random subset of the data and a random subset of the input variables. By doing this, the model becomes less sensitive to individual examples or features, which helps to reduce overfitting. Additionally, the technique of bagging is used to further reduce overfitting by averaging the outputs of multiple trees trained on different subsets of the data."
